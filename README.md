# Books

## A book review website.

### Users will be able to register for this website and they will also be able to login using their username and password
### Users who are logged in will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books and see the review made by other people
### Users will also be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the websiteâ€™s API I built

### Credits to the third party API by Goodreads, another book review website. This API was used to pull in ratings from a broader audience.
